Here is the complete corrected Python code:

```python
def test(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Explanation: The error message indicates that a colon (:) is expected after the function definition. In Python, a colon is used to denote the start of a block, such as a function or class definition, or a loop or conditional statement. I added the missing colon at the end of the function definition to fix the error. The original functionality of the code, which is to return the sum of two parameters `a` and `b`, is preserved.
