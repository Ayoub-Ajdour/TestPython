Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def test(a, b):
    return a + b
```

The error was due to a missing colon (:) at the end of the function definition. I've added the colon to fix the syntax error. The function now correctly defines a function named `test` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.
