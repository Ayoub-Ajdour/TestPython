Here's the complete corrected code:

```python
def test(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Explanation:
The error message indicates a SyntaxError, which means there's an issue with the syntax of the Python code. In this case, the colon (:) is missing at the end of the function definition. Adding the colon after the function parameters fixes the error.
