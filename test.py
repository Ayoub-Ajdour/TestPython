It seems like there's been a misunderstanding. The original code you provided doesn't actually contain the error you mentioned, and the error message seems to refer to a different piece of code.

However, if I understand correctly, you want me to correct the code that's causing the error message you provided. The error message suggests that there's an unterminated string literal, which means a string is not properly closed.

Here's an example of how to fix an unterminated string literal error:

```python
# Original code with the error
# def test(a, b)
#     return 'Here's the result: ' + str(a + b)

# Corrected code
def test(a, b):
    return "Here's the result: " + str(a + b)
```

In this corrected code:

*   I added a colon (:) at the end of the function definition to fix the SyntaxError.
*   I replaced the outer single quotes with double quotes to avoid a conflict with the single quote in "Here's".

However, if you could provide the actual original code causing the error, I'll be happy to assist you further.
