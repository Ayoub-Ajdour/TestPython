Here is the corrected code:

```python
def test(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Explanation: The error was caused by a missing colon (:) at the end of the function definition line. I added the colon to fix the syntax error. The corrected code preserves the original functionality of the `test` function, which takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.
